# 🚀 Eventify – Smart Event Planning & Vendor Bidding Platform  

## 🌍 Overview  

Eventify is a full-stack event management web application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

It simplifies event planning by connecting:

- 👤 Customers
- 🎯 Event Managers  
- 🏢 Vendors (Photography, Catering, Venue, Decoration, etc.)

Instead of contacting multiple vendors manually and negotiating individually, users can:

✔ Post event requirements  
✔ Receive competitive quotations  
✔ Compare prices  
✔ Negotiate  
✔ Finalize bookings  

Eventify makes event planning structured, transparent, and stress-free.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Planning an event today is:

- Unstructured
